    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A gluten-free, grain-free, paleo, sugar-free, low carb, keto friendly, dairy-free, egg-free and yeast free bread. Yay!

        <h3>Why This Recipe Works</h3>
        <strong>Simple and quick.</strong> My flax bread requires only 4 main ingredients.
        Plus, I've added a few extras that improve the flavor (flax all on its own is not the best tasting).
        The dough comes together with just a spoon and minimal kneading. The total prep time is only 10 minutes!
        <strong>Versatile.</strong> The bread tastes great toasted and it works with sweet and savoury toppings. It also freezes well. Enjoy it for breakfast, as a sandwich or alongside soups or salads. It is filling and very satisfying.

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flaxseed</li>
        <li>Sunflower Seeds</li>
        <li>Psyllium Husk</li>
        <li>Oil</li>

        <li>Warm Water</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Blend the flaxseeds to a fine flour in a high-speed blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the flaxseed meal into a large mixing bowl. Stir in the psyllium husk powder,
        sunflower seeds, baking powder, salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the apple cider vinegar, oil and warm water and stir with a spoon to
        combine. Then, knead with your hands for a few seconds until a smooth dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the dough rest for a couple of minutes to allow the flaxseed to expand. Then,
        fill it into the prepared loaf pan and smooth with a spatula. Top with seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the bread in the preheated oven on the middle shelf until golden and a skewer
        inserted comes out clean. Then, turn off the heat and leave the bread in the oven for
        a further 10 minutes.

        Let the bread cool fully before cutting. I like to make it the night before and leave
        out to cool overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
