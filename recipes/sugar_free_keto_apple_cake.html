    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <h4>Prepare Apples</h4>
      <li>
        Slice one apple and dice the rest.

        Place them in a mixing bow. Squeeze over a little lemon juice to prevent browning and
        drain any excess to prevent sogginess. Stir in the sweetener and let the mix sit for
        30 minutes to macerate.
      </li>
      <h4>Cake Batter</h4>
      <li>
        In a large bowl using an electric mixer or in a food processor, beat the room
        temperature eggs until pale, fluffy and double in size. This takes about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sweetener, butter, cream cheese, almond milk and vanilla extract. Continue
        beating for another 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the almond flour, Â¼ cup coconut flour, baking powder and cinnamon in a separate
        bowl. Then add to the wet ingredients and blend until you have a smooth batter. 
      </li>
      <h4>Crumble</h4>
      <li>
        Mix all ingredients in a separate bowl using a fork and set aside. 
      </li>
      <h4>Assembly</h4>
      <li>
        Separate the apple slices from the diced apple. Mix the chopped apples through the
        cake batter and fill the prepared springform cake pan (don't forget to line the
        bottom with parchment paper and grease the sides first!). 
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the apple slices on top in a single layer. Top off with the streusel mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven on the middle shelf for 60-65 minutes or until a skewer
        inserted comes out free of dough. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the apple coffee cake cool completely before releasing and removing the
        springform. Grain free baked goods are very fragile when hot and firm up as they cool.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Recipe Tips And Substitutions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Don't let it burn:</strong>  Almond flour cakes brown quicker than cakes made
        with wheat. Check the cake after 35-40 minutes oven time. If the top of the cake has
        browned sufficiently, loosely cover it with a piece of aluminium foil to prevent
        burning. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No coconut flour -</strong> To make this keto apple cake without coconut flour, replace it with
        3 times the amount of almond flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dairy free -</strong> For a dairy free keto apple cake, replace the butter with coconut oil and
        the cream cheese with coconut cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nut free -</strong> Try a blend of sesame flour and sunflower seed flour in place of the almond
        flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Using different fruits -</strong> This cake would work well with berries, although I would
        leave the cinnamon out of the cake batter. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Using a different cake pan:</strong> You could use a rectangular pan if you prefer and even
        make a no sugar added cinnamon apple dump cake - where the apple mix is at the bottom,
        topped by the batter. 
      </li>
    </ol>
